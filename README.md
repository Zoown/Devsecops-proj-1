ABOUT THE PROJECT
This site provides a structured layout for showcasing available apartments, incorporating modern UI/UX principles with future potential for interactive features. This project still lacks many important features and is incomplete.

The focus of this project has been to establish the backend coupled with responsive design. Integrate a database, authentication and filtering apartments. Hence the lack of frontend design.
